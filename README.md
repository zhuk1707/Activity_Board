# Activity Board - Time tracking dashboard

A small project to practice my CSS Grid skills,  JavaScript skills and 
working with data using JSON data file. To complete the 
task, I used HTML, SCSS, JavaScript.

My users should be able to:
* View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
* See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
* Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats
